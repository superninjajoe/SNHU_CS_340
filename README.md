-How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 

I tried to create something that made sense and was readable. I avoided cutting corners. I created something secure. It was interesting and fun to create a Python environment like this. Especially when working in a database.

-What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

With a database and Python, there is a lot that can be used. Contact information, incidents, and business bids. It created a layout that was easy to read from a user’s perspective. The widgets were creative and helpful. 

-How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 

I wanted to create something easy for the user to read and access. I wanted it to be cleaned and not overbearing with information. It was meant for me to create something that would be easy for the user to navigate and continue to make improvements to it.
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?

-What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I’m not certain which will work best. I want to find a better way to manage and create databases. Since I am still new, I am still finding ways to improve my skillset in general and am open to constructive criticism. 

-What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 

They analyze user requirements to design and develop software and hardware requirements for their users. It is used to solve problems in multiple practices. 

-How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Since I know the way this type of software works, I can help optimize it. Although I am still learning, I can be a sponge for best practices with no bad habits to bring to the table.
